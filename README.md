# downloadian
Python HTTP (Proxy+) File Downloader

### Description or Why is it all about reinvention the wheel
I started coding "Downloadian" just for learning and fun. The work this console program does any web-browser does.
Some tags for you: Sockets in Python (3.4, actually), HTTP protocol, Proxy authorization.

### Manual
1. If you don't use proxy-server, all you need is to COPY-and-PASTE your URL and press ENTER.
2. If you do use proxy-server:
   1. Find this string in code: ```username, password = '', ''```;
   2. Initialize variables ```username``` and ```password``` using your brain and hands;
   3. Launch the program and type ```proxy```;
   4. Finally, COPY-and-PASTE URL and press ENTER.

That is the way it works.
